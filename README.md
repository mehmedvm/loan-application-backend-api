Business Problem/Scope Statement:
The main functionality of the application is to create data, update existing data, and delete data in a very efficient  and flexible way. The GUI side of the LAS application makes it very easy, fast, and friendly to manipulate the use of data. This application is developed to store loan application data on MySQL database such as borrower name, address, phone number, and credit score, etc. GUI is an interface that makes use of links, images and other visual clues such as icons to facilitate the use of the application. To transform  data to a graphical interface, we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. In addition to that, you can generate reports and use different queries to customize data for required needs of the moment from the back-end. You will have a front-end view of all the loan application data based on the service you prefer.  


Project Objectives:

Project functions defined below:
Front-end and back-end applications

Project Description: 
The Loan application is the management platform where loan manager can add their required data and manage as the requirements needs to:
Loan Manager able to add their data and login into their accounts to check their information
Database admins can add the data through their admin privileges on the back-end and then they can manipulate data as the requirement defined. 
Database admins have permissions to generate customized  reports and able to export data files in CSV, HTML, JSON, SQL INSERT statement, XL Spreadsheet, XML (mysql format), and Tab separated formats
Generate an exception report that identifies problem situation and employees

Functioning devices like laptops, PCs, iPad, and Android mobile devices with up to date operating system, with the assumption that these devices support application interface
A GUI system will be used to navigate front end applications. The GUI will provide options such as navigating to each service and to the home page. 
Searching the inventory, checking out database, checking in equipment, adding loans, and removing loan application. MySQL Workbench to maintain a centralized database that stores information in back-end database. 
Front-End is enabled to perform all the CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. 

Software Engineering Best Practices:
Favor Composition (Has a Relationship) over Inheritance (Is a Relationship) 
Program to Interfaces 
DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
KISS (Keep it simple) 
Encapsulate Changes
Single Responsibility for Objects
Open to extend and closed to mutate
